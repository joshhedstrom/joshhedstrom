### Hey 🍃
I'm Josh Hedstrom. I was a senior full stack software engineer with a strong focus on the frontend, and now I'm an accomplished Engineering Manager with proven experience of leading teams through complex technical modernization and transformation. I've architected and implemented cutting-edge, composable tech stacks that drive business agility and scalability. 

I lead with rapid execution and clear communication across all organizational levels. I've successfully orchestrated cross-department initiatives to deliver business critical projects. I lead agile, fast moving teams that ship modern products to serve as a catalyst for business growth.

<!-- ### Philosophies and Paradigms 🌳

- 👋 Communication. It's my #1 skill and passion. Over communcation, especially with remote teams, is rare.
- 🎧 Focus. Devs should be expected to have regularly scheduled focus times free from meetings and email/slack/teams notifications.
- 🤝 Code Reviews. Especially with junior devs, I come alongside them and have them explain their thought process, and then try to offer insight about how the code could be improved, thus helping them grow in their problem solving and development process so that they write better code in the future.
- 💻 Developer Autonomy. Let the dev work. Be anti-micromanagement. Communicate (thoughtfully) always and don't assume the worst about your developers.
- 🚀 Kanban. I love it, because it forces prioritization and removes arbitrary deadlines, thus the relationship between the dev and the product manager/owner is improved.
- 🛠 Expectations. Typescript and 100% test coverage won't save you from bad code. They are tools to write and enforce better code, but in an ever changing tech landscape, code needs to be malleable and dynamic. We strive for the best code possible, not perfect code.
- 🌴 Work/Life balance. We still live analog lives. Work hard, and have regularly scheduled times to turn off notifications, put away the phone and laptop, and breathe fresh air. Work is not who we are, it's what we do, but it's not all we do and shouldn't be all we do. -->
